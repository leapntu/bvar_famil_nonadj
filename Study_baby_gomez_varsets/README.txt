# Procedure to run the Baby Gomez Varset (Nonadjacencies) experiment

Participants
We want to get a sample similar to Rebecca Gomez 2002, namely 32-40 infants with an average age of 18 months 18 days (her range: 17 months 11 days to 19 months 18 days). 

Note: Gomez tested 48 infants in 3 conditions, but here we only have 2 conditions (Varset, Scrambled). Note that 18 extra babies were tested but not included because of excessive fussiness (12) or technical difficulties (6).

MATERIALS
This AXB artificial grammar contains 2 A_B non-adjacent dependencies and 12 X elements.

PROCEDURE

Familiarization

Assign the first half of the infants to the Varset condition. If babies show a novelty effect (as in Gomez) listening significantly longer to untrained than to trained strings, then test the other half of the babies to the Scramble condition.

Varset: play the 48 .wav files under /famil-varset in the exact order indicated by the numbering system.

Scramble: play the 48 .wav files under /famil-scramble in the exact order indicated by the numbering system.


TEST - Central Screen Preferential Looking Procedure
All babies hear the same test trials regardless of familiarization condition.

There are two sets of 6 AXB strings. One set is trained (grammatical) the other is untrained (ungrammatical).

Each test trial consists of the set of 6 strings from either the Trained or Untrained set, in one of four pseudo-random orders.

The four test sets (Trained in Order 1, Trained in  Order 2, Trained in Order 3, Trained in order 4, Untrained in Order 1, Untrained in  Order 2, Untrained in Order 3, Untrained in order 4) are each presented once during the test (in two test blocks), for a total of eight test trials. Test sets are 21 s in duration.

The test set/trial files are 8 files located under /test-trials, and should be played in RANDOM order.
